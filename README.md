## 🧠 What is Project ATLAS?

Project ATLAS is a long-term AI research program focused on building a new class of artificial intelligence systems that are:

- Adaptive (continual learning over time)  
- Lightweight (efficient and deployable)  
- Autonomous (self-monitoring and self-improving)  
- Multimodal (text, vision, structured data)

ATLAS is not a single model or application.  
It is a unified research platform for studying how real-world intelligent systems can learn, remember, reason, and evolve.

---

## 🎯 Current Objective

The first phase of ATLAS is the development of **ATLAS-Core**:

A minimal unified system that integrates:

- multimodal perception  
- memory and knowledge storage  
- continual learning  
- efficiency-aware design  

This system will serve as the basis for the first ATLAS research paper.

## 🏗 Research Directions

- Continual and lifelong learning  
- Memory-centric AI systems  
- Efficient and edge-deployable intelligence  
- Multimodal reasoning  
- Autonomous system behavior
