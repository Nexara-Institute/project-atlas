# ATLAS Unified Architecture  
## System Design Document

Flagship system of Project ATLAS — NEXARA Institute

---

## 1. System Vision

Describe the kind of intelligence ATLAS represents.
(Adaptive, lightweight, autonomous, multimodal, real-world capable.)

---

## 2. Core Design Principles

- Continual adaptation by design  
- Efficiency and deployability as first-class constraints  
- Modular and extensible architecture  
- Multimodal information fusion  
- Autonomous reasoning and control  

---

## 3. High-Level System Overview

Explain the full system at a block level.

Example modules:
- Perception Layer
