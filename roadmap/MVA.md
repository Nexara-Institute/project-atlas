## 1. Purpose of ATLAS-Core

ATLAS-Core is the first implemented instantiation of Project ATLAS.

Its purpose is not completeness, scale, or productization.

Its purpose is to produce a **publishable scientific system** that demonstrates the core principles of the ATLAS vision:

- continual adaptation  
- unified multimodal representation  
- persistent memory integration  
- efficiency-aware system design  

ATLAS-Core serves as:

- the experimental platform for ATLAS Paper #1  
- the foundation for all future ATLAS systems  
- a testbed for adaptive and lightweight intelligence research  

---

## 2. Scientific Objectives

ATLAS-Core is designed to answer the following foundational research questions:

1. Can a unified memory-centric architecture support continual multimodal learning without catastrophic forgetting?
2. Can efficiency-constrained systems maintain strong multimodal reasoning performance?
3. Does architectural unification (fusion + memory + continual learning) outperform isolated components?

The system must therefore support:

- sequential task learning  
- cross-modal representation  
- memory growth and retrieval  
- measurable efficiency constraints  

---

## 3. System Scope (What ATLAS-Core Must Include)

ATLAS-Core v0.1 will implement the **smallest complete intelligence loop** that supports publication-grade experimentation.

### Required Core Components

#### 3.1 Multimodal Perception
- Lightweight text encoder  
- Lightweight vision encoder  
- Unified embedding projection layer  

Purpose: enable multimodal representation under efficiency constraints.

---

#### 3.2 Unified Representation & Fusion
- Shared latent space  
- Cross-modal fusion mechanism  
- Semantic compression layer  

Purpose: allow joint reasoning across modalities.

---

#### 3.3 Memory & Knowledge Core
- Episodic memory buffer  
- Prototype / concept memory  
- Retrieval mechanism  

Purpose: support continual learning, experience accumulation, and replay.

---

#### 3.4 Continual Learning Engine
- Incremental update mechanism  
- Forgetting-mitigation strategy  
- Memory-aware optimization  

Purpose: enable long-term learning without catastrophic forgetting.

---

#### 3.5 Reasoning Head
- Task-agnostic reasoning module  
- Multimodal prediction head  

Purpose: provide a measurable reasoning interface independent of task domain.

---

#### 3.6 Efficiency Layer
- Parameter budget enforcement  
- Modular activation control  
- Memory footprint tracking  

Purpose: make efficiency an explicit research variable.

## 4. Explicit Non-Goals (for v0.1)

The following are intentionally excluded from ATLAS-Core v0.1:

- large-scale foundation models  
- robotics or physical embodiment  
- complex multi-agent systems  
- full natural language agents  
- application-specific deployments  

These are future ATLAS programs, not ATLAS-Core objectives.

---

## 5. Experimental Capabilities

ATLAS-Core must support the following experimental classes:

### 5.1 Continual Multimodal Learning
- sequential multimodal tasks  
- incremental domain exposure  
- memory consolidation  
- performance retention measurement  

---

### 5.2 Memory-Centric Evaluation
- memory growth over time  
- retrieval contribution  
- replay effectiveness  
- representation stability  

---

### 5.3 Efficiency-Aware Evaluation
- parameter count  
- inference latency  
- memory consumption  
- computational cost  

---

### 5.4 Architectural Ablations
- without memory  
- without continual engine  
- without fusion  
- without efficiency constraints  

Purpose: isolate architectural contributions.

---

## 6. Success Criteria

ATLAS-Core is considered successful when it can:

- run sequential multimodal learning experiments  
- demonstrate reduced forgetting vs baselines  
- show benefit of memory integration  
- maintain a lightweight computational profile  
- support reproducible evaluation pipelines  
- generate figures suitable for a research paper  

---

## 7. Relationship to ATLAS Paper #1

ATLAS-Core is the **exclusive experimental system** for:

**ATLAS Paper #1 —  
“A Unified Adaptive and Lightweight Architecture for Continual Multimodal Intelligence”**

All architectural decisions, experiments, and metrics in ATLAS-Core must directly support the claims of this paper.

---

## 8. Development Phases

### Phase I — Core Infrastructure
- modular system skeleton  
- encoders and fusion  
- memory implementation  
- training and evaluation loops  

---

### Phase II — Continual Intelligence
- continual task streams  
- forgetting mitigation  
- memory consolidation  
- baseline comparisons  

---

### Phase III — Scientific Validation
- ablation studies  
- efficiency profiling  
- robustness tests  
- paper-grade result generation  

---

## 9. Long-Term Role in Project ATLAS

ATLAS-Core is not a disposable prototype.

It is the **root system** from which future ATLAS variants will emerge:

- ATLAS-Autonomy  
- ATLAS-Edge  
- ATLAS-Healthcare  
- ATLAS-Agents  

Each future ATLAS system must trace its lineage back to ATLAS-Core.
